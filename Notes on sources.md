Santamaria, Angie. “Queercoding Villians and the Hays Code.” _Penn State Presidential Leadership Academy PLA_, Penn State, 3 Mar. 2021, sites.psu.edu/academy/2021/03/03/queercoding-villians-and-the-hays-code/.
### Important facts
1. The Hays code's view that good things must happen to good people, combined with the view of the LGBT community as immoral lead to the queercoding of villains
2. This issue continues to this day despite the Hays code no longer being in effect

Important quotes (w/ MLA citations)
1. "queer people were seen to have “lower moral standards,” not living in “correct standards of life,” or “law-divine Queer people could not be explicitly portrayed in the film as “good people”- of a writer wanted their character to be queer, it couldn’t be explicit in their medium, and the character was not allowed to “win” in the end." (Santamaria 6)
2. "This code’s backbone enforced the idea that good things happen to good people (the heteronormative straits), and since queer people are inherently evil, they cannot have happy outcomes." (Santamaria 6)
3. "Queercoding villains are so dangerous BECAUSE it is already institutionalized in the media we have consumed for an entire lifetime; sometimes it is so subtle that it is hard to recognize. And when that subliminal messaging is repeated repeatedly, some people may start to believe it and act upon it." (Santamaria 7)

### Important Facts
1. The Motion Picture Production Code, colloquially known as the Hay's code, was a code describing what was and wasn't allowed in film from 1934-68
2. "Pre-Code" films are films that come before the widespread enforcement of the Hay's code
### Important Quotes
1. "The Hays Code specified what content was acceptable and unacceptable for films for public audiences in the US. One of its founding principles is that 'No picture should lower the moral standards of those who see it.''" (Tew 8).
2. "The Hays Code was adopted by the movie industry to retain control of the industry through self-regulation and streamline the production and distribution process for US films.  // Prior to and after the Code, state and local film censorship boards determined what was acceptable or unacceptable for their audiences. This meant that US studios producing films for national audiences risked bans in large markets over questionable content. Sometimes films were edited and multiple versions created to pass the censorship boards, requiring more time, money, and work by the studios.  // The Roaring Twenties, the period immediately preceding the creation of the Code, saw many shocking Hollywood scandals, including the murder of director William Desmond Taylor and alleged violent rape of Virginia Rappe by the well-known star Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle. High-profile trials and investigations drew increased scrutiny from film censorship boards and legislators who began passing film censorship bills and decency laws. In 1921 alone over one hundred film censorship laws were put forward. // The Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (later the Motion Picture Association) decided it was better to police themselves than to try to wade through complex and constantly changing state and local decency laws, so the code was adopted in 1930 and enforced beginning in 1934." (Tew 13-16).
